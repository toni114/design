                         <div class="blog-post-des">
							 <p></p>
							 
							<p> <blockquote> <span><i class="fa fa-frown-o"></i></span> &nbsp;With this increasing use of online chart, there is a trend that, besides content itself, people eager to exchange emotions.&nbsp;Current methods like emoji of expression will interrupt the flow of the chat because they occupy the same channel. Additionally, these ways can hardly express mixed emotion.  </blockquote>
							 
							 
							 <p>it is necessary to find a new method to <strong><span class="im"> help mixed emotional communication be conducted during online chat.</span></strong></p>
							 
								<h3>CONCEPT</h3>
							 <p>Under the permission of both users, the camera of computer or mobile phone actively detects both their <span class="im">facial expressions</span> and transmits the facial images to server to define the expression. After analyzing the image, the server returns results to the receiver’s computer/mobile phone and the interface displays their chatting partners’ mixed emotion by <span class="im">gradient color</span>.<br> So that <span class="im">a new channel</span> is added to help emotional communication.</p>

							  <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
							 
                             
							  <p style="color:#54A4c7;font-size:20px">Color Emotion</p>
				   <p>Colors have a strong impact on people’s emotions. Research shows that many kinds of emotion can be sensed from some specific colors. Some related psychological studies show that there are marked associations between colors and feelings, and <span class="im">people can be emotionally sensitive to many specific colors.</span> Color emotion means the semantic words describing the characteristics of colors and human’s emotional responses to colors.</p>
				   
				   <p>However, research also shows that color preference <span class="im">varies</span> among people and is culturally-based. Gender, age and many other factors would affect people’s feeling to colors.We need to consider this factor when design the prototype.</p><p>it could be reasonable to utilize colors to demonstrate people’s emotion.</p>
							 
							   
                             
							 
							 <h3>PROTOTYPE</h3>
				   
				   <img src="https://ning114.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/ce-prototype.png" class="img-responsive" alt="prptotype">
				   <br>
							 <p>The protoype contains 3 parts:affective recognition,classify emotions and display emotions on the interface </p>
							
							 <p style="font-size:20px; color:#54a4c7">Affective Recognition</p>
							 <p>Affective Computing is an interdisciplinary field which deals with the problem of how computers or devices interact with human’s affect.Different methods have been used to detect affect like detecting human’s physiological response to emotions such as facial expression, tone changes and other kinds of physiological variations. </p>
							 <p>Since we apply this function on the daily online chat, facial recognition is the best choice.Because facial recognition doesn't need complicated device as other methods and we can easily utilize the camera of computer and mobile phone.</p>
								<blockquote><p>We decided use Microsoft cognitive service API to quickly build.<br>
									 
									<span><i class="fa fa-thumb-tack"></i></span> &nbsp;The types of emotions in this service are <span class="im">anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness and surprise.</span> These emotions are understood cross-culturally and universally communicated with particular facial expressions.
									
								<br>
										<span><i class="fa fa-thumb-tack"></i></span> &nbsp;Once you send an image to the server, the server will return 8 values of confidence of this 8 emotions. </p>
							 </blockquote>
							 
							 <p style="font-size:20px; color:#54a4c7">Classify Emotions</p>
							 
							 
							 <p> The eight basic types of emotion that Microsoft service define are hard for users to get used to so we divide these eight colors into four groups based on J. A. Russell’s theory. Russell measures emotion with two dimensions: arousal and pleasant.</p>

							 
							 <p style="font-size:20px; color:#54a4c7">Display Emotions-Translate Emotions into Colors</p>
							 
							 <p>We matched the four emotional groups to four basic colors—red, orange, blue and green. picture above shows a sample of how we “translate” the returned results into the gradient color by proportions.</p> 
								<blockquote>	
									<p><span><i class="fa fa-thumb-tack"></i></span> &nbsp;Considering that each person may have different color-emotion match choice, we made this corresponding relationship between emotion and color <span class="im">changeable</span>. 
							 </p>
									<p> <span><i class="fa fa-thumb-tack"></i></span> &nbsp;What’s more, we don’t recommend people with defective color vison to use this design, if they want to, the word of the emotion type can be shown on the gradient bar. </p>

							<p>Each pair of couples or lovers were asked to conduct three rounds of 10-minutes online chatting. Before each round, each participant was asked to solely watch a prepared emotional video. The videos can evoke their emotions and help provide chatting content. During each round, participants were requested to stay in different rooms (so their emotions would not be visible to each other) and asked to chat online with each other. </p>
							<p>After each round of chat, one participant was selected to choose their ten most emotional sentences from their chatting content and both of the participants had to choose one or two types of emotion expressed in those sentences. If they choose two emotions, it meant that the emotion was mixed and so they have to select which was the primary emotion and which was the secondary. After all the rounds of chatting, every participant was asked to complete a questionnaire and conduct a short interview to give their feedback on the design. </p>

							 <p>From the test, we found that users were keen to comprehend their partners’ emotions and most of them reported that they felt better understood. They thought the ease of the design was acceptable and the emotion bar was very interesting. They were more involved in their conversations using new design interface since complex emotions could be expressed, and most of them were satisfied with this design. <span class="im">This preliminary test shows that this online chat interface design, which aims to help mixed emotion communication can be useful for lovers chatting.</span>

							 	<h3>FUTURE</h3>
							
							  
								<p>
									  <p>Besides the problem tallked above,there are still some problems.
										  <br> For the design part:
										  <br>1. The current design only allows users to match four <span class="im">kinds of colors</span> to their emotions which limits the users’ choice. One user said that she thought all the four colors we provided looked soft and she could hardly feel strong emotions like anger.
										  <br>2. The <span class="im">frequency</span> at which we detected the users’ emotions was not enough because the send-and-return process required a minimum of 2 seconds, thus delating real-time emotion display. 
										  <br>3. Some participants argued that the types of<span class="im"> emotions we provided were not suitable</span>. For example, curiosity is expressed a lot in online chat but cannot be recognized by our system, whereas fear is rare in daily conversation.</p>
							
				   </div>

                            
						
								    
				   <p></p>
							    <blockquote><p>For the test part: The types of the participants are limited to couples or lovers and the number of the participants are not big. 
								<span class="im">The most important problem was that emotion, as a very complex object, is hard to judge accurately so it was challenging to identify how well a kind of emotion or a mixed emotion had been expressed. </span> </blockquote>
